Getting Started
===============

This page details how to get started with stabilizer_project. stabilizer_project is a package designed to help use and manipulate stabilizer states

Installation
------------
To install stabilizer_project, you will need an environment with the following packages:

* Python 3.8 or superior
* NumPy
* Qiskit
* Matplotlib (optional)
* Pylatexenc (optional)

Note, you only need Matplotlib and Pylatexenc if you want to plot the circuit. If you just want do do computation, or are fine with the circuits being drawn in the shell by qiskit, these are not required.
Once you have these packages installed, you can install stabilizer_project in the same environment using
::

    git clone https://github.com/nrmanohar/stabilizer_project.git
    cd stabilizer_project
    pip install -e .

Theory
------

Background
```````````
Quantum states are very important for the purposes of quantum computing. However, one issue with representing quantum states is that they grow exponentially.

.. math::
    N = 2^n

For a standard pure quantum state, the size of the vector needed to represent it grows exponentially. However, there is a solution. It turns out a subset of quantum
states can be represented by a set of stabilizers rather than a state vector (or a density operator). Suppose we have a unitary operator

.. math::
    U = \bigotimes_i^n \sigma_i

Which is a Kronecker product of Pauli operators. Let's suppose we have some state such that


.. math::
    U|\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle

We say that the operator :math:`U` stabilizes the state :math:`|\psi\rangle`. It turns out, for a stabilizer state, we can represent that state uniquely using :math:`n` stabilizers rather than a vector of size :math:`2^n`.


Group Theory
`````````````
For a crash course on group theory, a group is a set of elements with an associated binary operation (the set of integers with the operation of addition) that abide by four properties

1. Closed under binary operation.
2. There exists an identity element.
3. For every element of the group, there exists an inverse.
4. The operation is associative.

| Closure means that if we do the binary operation to two elements in the group, the output remains in the group. The identity element is an element of the group that, under operation, leaves the element unchanged (like the number 0 in addition or the identity matrix). The inverse is an element of the group when operated with an element, returns the identity. And associativity just means that the grouping of terms do not matter. We're not going to go too deep into the math here, but for our purposes the groups we're using will operate under standard matrix multiplication
| Suppose we have a stabilizer state :math:`|\psi\rangle`. Let :math:`N=2^n` and :math:`G` be a group such that

.. math::
    G = \{P\in P(N):P|\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle\}

Where :math:`P(N)\subseteq U(N)` such that all :math:`M\in P` is a tensor product of Pauli matrices. We say this is the stabilizer group for the state :math:`|\psi\rangle`. If you want, you can prove that :math:`G` is in fact a group. However, this doesn't really help us, since can be a very large set. But we have something else to help us.
Every group has a set of *generators*. We denote the set of generators as :math:`S`. We denote :math:`\langle S\rangle` as the set of all combinations of the elements of :math:`S`, and in and of itself form a group. If :math:`G = \langle S\rangle`, we say :math:`S` generates :math:`G`.
If we choose a generating set carefully, they can form our *representation* of the state. We can use :math:`n` matrices to represent the state instead of a :math:`2^n` size vector.

One important thing to note, the set of stabilizers is not unique. For example, take the standard bell state :math:`|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)`. I can generate it's set of stabilizers from the generating set :math:`S = \{ZZ,XX\}`, but I can also generate the same set from the generators :math:`S=\{XX,-YY\}`

However, an important caveat, your stabilizers must be 'independent' of each other (sort of analogous to Linear Independence). What does that mean? Let's have a stabilizer state :math:`\ket{\psi}` with stabilizers :math:`\{g_1,g_2\ldots g_m\}`

If we generate a group from them we get :math:`G = \langle g_1,g_2\ldots g_m\rangle`

Here's the key, let's generate a group :math:`G' = \langle g_1\ldots g_{i-1},g_{i+1}\ldots g_n\rangle` where we removed one arbitrary generator. No matter which generater we removed, :math:`G'\subset G`. In other words, removing one of the generators reduces the size of your group. If this is true, we say our generators are 'independant.'

For large states, it's hard to determine by inspection. However, this package comes pre-built with verification for independence of generators.

Clifford Operations
````````````````````
The Clifford group are the set of all operations that can be formed using CNOT, Phase (denoted as :math:`S` in the package), and Hadamard Gates. It turns out, applying a Clifford unitary on a stabilizer state converts it into another stabilizer state. Moreover, any stabilizer state can be realized from any other stabilizer state by means of clifford operations.
Now this package also allows for more operations. Consider the Pauli rotations

.. math::
    \sigma_z = S^2

.. math::
    \sigma_x = HZH = HS^2H

.. math::
    \sigma_y = SXS^\dagger=SHZHS^\dagger = SHZHS^3

So every rotation is a Clifford operator, and is thus built into our package. Similarly

.. math::
    \text{CZ} = (I\otimes H)\text{CNOT}(I\otimes H)

So the default Clifford operations this package utilizes are CNOT, H, S, X, Y, Z, and CZ gates.

Tableau Formalism
```````````````````
This package utilizes a way to represent :math:`S` as an :math:`n\times 2n` matrix given as

.. math::
    T=\left(\begin{array}{c|c}  
    X & Z
    \end{array}\right)

| Where the :math:`i` th row denotes the :math:`i` th stabilizer. Let's examine the :math:`X` and :math:`Y` matrices separately. Note these are both square :math:`n\times n` matrices. In each of these matrices, the :math:`j` th row denotes the :math:`j` th qubit.
| Let :math:`S_{i,j}` be the :math:`j` th Pauli of the :math:`i` th stabilizer (For example, if :math:`S_1=XZ` and :math:`S_2=ZX`, then :math:`S_{1,1}=X` and :math:`S_{2,1}=Z`). We denote the following using our Tableau

1. We denote :math:`S_{i,j}=I` as :math:`X_{i,j}=0` and :math:`Z_{i,j}=0`
2. We denote :math:`S_{i,j}=Z` as :math:`X_{i,j}=0` and :math:`Z_{i,j}=1`
3. We denote :math:`S_{i,j}=X` as :math:`X_{i,j}=1` and :math:`Z_{i,j}=0`
4. We denote :math:`S_{i,j}=Y` as :math:`X_{i,j}=1` and :math:`Z_{i,j}=1`

However, if you remember, a set of stabilizers for the standard bell state is :math:`S=\{XX,-YY\}`. Note the second stabilizer is :math:`-YY`. To account for this, we define a signvector, which denotes the sign of the :math:`i` th stabilizer. So with the signvector, we can denote this state as

.. math::
    T=\left(\begin{array}{cc|cc|c}  
    1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1
    \end{array}\right)

| Where the last column represents the signvector.
| In this package, we use a numpy array to represent our Tableau. As such, we index from 0 to :math:`n-1` rather than from 1 to :math:`n`, and the signvector is a separate entity from the tableau

Examples
----------
Here's a sample code with the stabilizer_project package

.. code-block:: python

    from stabilizer_project import *
    state = Stabilizer()
    state.report()

which generates the output

::

    [[1. 1. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 1. 1.]]
    [0. 0.]

As you can see, this is the tableau for the standard bell state. However, this isn't that useful. If you want to initialize :math:`n` qubits in the :math:`|0\rangle` state, we can instead say

.. code-block:: python

    state = Stabilizer(5)
    state.report()

which generates the output

::

    [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]
    [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

Let's do an example, building the GHZ state

.. code-block:: python

    state = Stabilizer(3)
    state.report()

Which generates the output

::

    [[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]
    [0. 0. 0.]

We will then apply a Hadamard to the first qubit

.. code-block:: python

    state.clifford('h',0)
    state.report()

Which generates the output

::

    [[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]
    [0. 0. 0.]

We then apply two CNOTs

.. code-block:: python

    state.clifford('cnot',0,1)
    state.clifford('cnot',1,2)
    state.report()

which generates the final tableau of

::

    [[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1.]]
    [0. 0. 0.]

However, if we have a complicated tableau, it might be hard to figure out what it's saying. Consider a state with the following tableau

::

    [[1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0.]
     [0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0.]
     [1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1.]
     [0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
     [1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
    [0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]

It's hard to make any sense of that. Fortunately, we have a method for that! If we had a state with the associated tableau, we can put

.. code-block:: python

    stabs=state.stabilizers()
    print(stabs)

and that generates the output

::

    ['XZZXI', 'IXZZX', 'XIXZZ', '-ZXIXZ', 'XXXXX']

| which is a lot easier to understand.
| Now, this might be cool, but how does one realize these states on a physical quantum computer. Our circuit comes with a circuit builder! Let's say our set of stabilizers are :math:`S=\{XZZXI, IXZZX, XIXZZ, ZXIXZ, ZZZZZ\}` (this is the logical 0 state in the 5 qubit error correction code)

.. code-block:: python

    state.new_stab(5,"XZZXI,IXZZX,XIXZZ,ZXIXZ,ZZZZZ")
    print(state.circuit_builder())

Generates the output

::

         ┌───┐                                     ┌───┐
    q_0: ┤ H ├────────────■───■───■────────────────┤ X ├──■──
         ├───┤            │   │   │ ┌───┐          └─┬─┘  │
    q_1: ┤ H ├──────■──■──┼───┼───■─┤ X ├───────■────┼────┼──
         ├───┤      │  │  │   │     └─┬─┘       │    │    │
    q_2: ┤ H ├──■───┼──■──┼───■───────┼────■────┼────■────┼──
         ├───┤  │   │     │           │  ┌─┴─┐  │       ┌─┴─┐
    q_3: ┤ H ├──■───■─────■───■───────■──┤ X ├──┼───────┤ X ├
         ├───┤┌───┐         ┌─┴─┐        └───┘┌─┴─┐     └───┘
    q_4: ┤ H ├┤ H ├─────────┤ X ├─────────────┤ X ├──────────
         └───┘└───┘         └───┘             └───┘

| But suppose you don't want to operate just in the terminal, or you want to save your circuit, or you want to just make it look nicer. The package has another method that makes this process streamlined (you will need the pylatexenc and matplotlib packages to do this).

.. code-block:: python

    state.draw_circuit()

Which generates the output

.. image:: Plot1.jpeg
  :width: 700
  :alt: Circuit for the logical 0 state of the 5 qubit error correction code
  :align: left

One of the most used applications of stabilizer formalism is defining and manipulating graph states. This package comes with that too!

We need an edgelist

.. code-block:: python

    edgelist = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,0]]

Each sublist represents a connection, between the two qubits numbered (indexed from 0 to :math:`n`)

Now if type

.. code-block:: python

    state = Stabilizer()
    state.graph_state(edgelist)
    state.draw_circuit()

Generates the output

.. image:: Plot2.jpeg
  :width: 700
  :alt: A graph state with edges (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), and (5,0)
  :align: left


The Inner Workings
-------------------
This section is more about the code of the package rather than the theory. Reading this section is not necessary for a background to use the package

Verification
`````````````
Since a lot of this package is self redundant, there needs to be a lot of verification to make sure your stabilizers are still up to standard

The first check is done by numpy itself. If your stabilizers don't form the right dimensions, it'll break numpy and return a numpy error.

The first real check done is to check whether the number of Pauli's in a stabilizer matches the number of stabilizers

The second check done by the package is an empty column check. That basically means whether or not you have a free qubit, which is not a unique state. 

The third check is commuter check, which would take :math:`\mathcal{O}(n^2)` time, checks that each stabilizer commutes with each other stabilizer. 

The fourth and final check is linear independence. There's a theorem in Nielson and Chuang that says the generators are independent if and only if the rows of the tableau are linearly independent. Utilizing them in conjunction will force all of our stabilizers to be valid to describe a unique state.

Clifford Manipulations
```````````````````````
Clifford manipulations on Tableau are known, so the package just implements them. There are many papers and textbooks that have them described, the only work done by hand was checking signs.

Circuit builder
`````````````````
This is the most challenging and difficult part of the package. The basic idea is to utilize the fact that every stabilizer state :math:`\ket{\psi}` can be converted to a graph state :math:`\ket{g}`

.. math::
    \ket{\psi}\overset{\text{Clifford}}{\rightarrow} \ket{g}

And graph states have known generation schemes that if you undo gets you from the graph state :math:`\ket{g}` the :math:`\ket{0}^{\otimes n}`

.. math::
    \ket{g}\overset{\text{Clifford}}{\rightarrow}\ket{0}^{\otimes n}

So the idea is to combine them to obtain a set of transformations that transforms

.. math::
    \ket{\psi}\overset{\text{Clifford}}{\rightarrow}\ket{0}^{\otimes n}

Then if you reverse the order of the transformations (and replace any :math:`S` with :math:`S^\dagger`) you get the generation scheme from the :math:`\ket{0}^{\otimes n}` to the target stabilizer state :math:`\ket{\psi}`

However, systematically converting from a stabilizer state to a graph state is non-trivial. There are various steps the algorithm takes relating to manipulating the tableau to convert it to a graph state, but since graph states have very well defined Tableau representations, a failure is heralded.
